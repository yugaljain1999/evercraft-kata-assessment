#### Feature: Character Can Be Damaged

> As an attacker I want to be able to damage my enemies so that they will die and I will live

- If attack is successful, other character takes 1 point of damage when hit
- If a roll is a natural 20 then a critical hit is dealt and the damage is doubled
- when hit points are 0 or fewer, the character is dead
