#### Feature: A Character Can Level

> As a character I want my experience points to increase my level and combat capabilities so that I can bring vengeance to my foes

- Level defaults to 1
- After 1000 experience points, the character gains a level
    - 0 xp -> 1st Level
    - 1000 xp -> 2nd Level
    - 2000 xp -> 3rd Level
    - etc.

Every time a level changes, add 5 + constitution modifier to hitpoints 
    
* 1 is added to attack roll for every EVEN level achieved
